# Python_Data_Analysis_Visualization
This course on Udemy is probably the web's best course on Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more! There were so many cool datasets and exciting projects!!!

We worked with dozens of fun and real-world datasets including Amazon bestsellers, Rivian stock prices, Presidential Tweets, Bitcoin historic data, and UFO sightings.

In the course, I practised on real datasets how to:

  - Work with Jupyter Notebooks
  
  - Use Pandas to read and manipulate datasets
  
  - Work with DataFrames and Series objects
  
  - Organize, filter, clean, aggregate, and analyze DataFrames
  
  - Extract and manipulate date, time, and textual information from data
  
  - Master Hierarchical Indexing

  - Merge datasets together in Pandas
  
  - Create complex visualizations with Matplotlib
  
  - Use Seaborn to craft stunning and meaningful visualizations
  
  - Create line, bar, box, scatter, pie, violin, rug, swarm, strip, and other plots!
